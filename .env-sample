# WEB_MEMORY is an estimate of the maximum amount of memory that could be used
# by a worker process. (64 is a conservative value, 32 might be fine.) It isnâ€™t
# directly used by the server code, but Heroku uses it to set WEB_CONCURRENCY
# by dividing the total amount of memory (512 MB in free/standard dynos) by
# WEB_MEMORY.
